# Auto Layout Book Log
Paul Solt

My Progress Log on writing the [Auto Layout Book](http://bit.ly/AutoLayoutBook)

## Goal

* Restructure the outline
* 1,500 words
* I can do … 800 words in 12 minutes … what can I do in 90 minutes?
* Just get words down, thoughts down, refine it later

* Wrote: 869 words 
* Inspired after watching "Dawn Wall" with Tommy Caldwell who scales the Yosemite "impossible" face called Dawn Wall.
	* 6 years working on a goal
		* Spring + Fall spent figuring out the traversals to make one unified climb
* Refactored the outline, it didn't feel right, but now I think I'm on the right track with the topics
* Updated sections, reordered to make more logical
	* Trying to make it as easy as possible to get something working
	* Then we'll explain more complexities … don't talk about what we don't need to talk about yet.

### New Section 1 Chapters

1. Auto Layout 101
2. Test Drive Auto Layout (Get in and do something)
3. Auto Layout Fundamentals
4. Layout  (You need more practice with layout before you constrain)
5. Thinking with Auto Layout (Paper prototyping? prep for design?)

* Started writing some ideas … busy day working on contract work and UI testing … still feels like docs aren't fleshed out … I have yet to find the updated Apple docs



## September 18 2018 21:58:07

* Wrote 804 words for Chapter 1
	* Starting point, but I'm starting to think that my daily word count is going to be closer to 2,000 words.
	* I didn't really get into the topic, and my outline doesn't quite flow
	* I'm going to cleanup Chapter 1 outline once more, and then hit the ground running
* Part of the process for writing … and doing this challenge is to push myself to think, eat, and breathe Auto Layout, so that I can write easier
* The more I consume the material, and refine my thoughts, the easier it will be to write this book
* Reading Essentialism has been amazing, habit's are what are going to make this book write itself, I just need to make sure I write daily … 
* I'm going to hang up a calendar that I can cross off each day I hit my word count … it's ok if I only write 50 words, as long as I continue the habit, it will continue to build, and my subconscious will be writing the book in my sleep
* I don't want this book to start off dry, I want to showcase real examples of Auto Layout in action, and then I want to break it down with a real world example
* I'm not here to talk about how constraints work, but how you can leverage constraints to make the UI you want
