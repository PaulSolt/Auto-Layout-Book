# Auto Layout Book Log
Paul Solt

My Progress Log on writing the [Auto Layout Book](http://bit.ly/AutoLayoutBook)

## Goal

* Restructure the outline
* 1,500 words
* I can do … 800 words in 12 minutes … what can I do in 90 minutes?
* Just get words down, thoughts down, refine it later

## September 24 2018 08:19:51

* 1558 words
* Setup a new private Github to track changes to the book manuscript
* Writing first thing in the morning (7:50am - 8:20am)
* Way easier to write on a fresh mind, and way more ideas
* Workbook ideas using "furniture arranging" to learn Layout
	* Instagram layout to adapt the design to the bigger screens
	* Or a simple button resizing example 
	* Cut out and layout the designs on the workbook iPhone 8 screen and the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max screens.

## September 23 2018 19:37:14

* 888 words
* Day 5
* I'm exhausted today after being in the sun all morning and early afternoon playing ultimate frisbee
* I set the timer, wrote the first set of words, and then started a second and kept going.
	* It felt good to start making some more progress, even if the writing quality is low right now, it's more important that I start to think through the different concepts, so that I can start to piece together the information that a beginner is going to need to know


## September 22 2018 21:24:12

* 1249 words
	* Got into talking about my experiences demo'ing bomb dodge, and howimpratnt it is to do usability testing to catch issues before you invest tons of time into features
* I'm again tired, trying to write at the end of the day because of all the activities
	* Today I ran my fastest 5K race at 21:37 … close to a 7'00" pace … but I haven't looked at any of my stats yet
	* We went to the market, and some food fests around Rochester
* I don't really feel like writing, and I just want to get more sleep.
* Tomorrow I'm getting up early, to write, so I'll definitely start to dig more into things … and I'm probably going to move writing to my 1st hour, like I wanted to, but haven't been able to do because of a contract deadline.
	* That'll make it easier to sit and write, and not have to waste time … not writing the book.
* Also, I'm super behind on finishing the chapters … so these chapters may or may not be short… we'll see.

## September 21 2018 22:41:11

* 787 words
* Tired, have a 5K race tomorrow … setting a timer for 5 minutes and then going to bed
	* Did another 5 minutes … got to 620 … why not type a bit more … =)
	* Going for a 22:00 5K time … 7'00" pace is my target
* Spent all day on contract work … and just got back from a late night Ultimate Frisbee game
* Had some fun programming a simple App Store keyword tool using NSLinguistics and text … very fun ideas for some projects


## September 20 2018 22:01:52

* 798 words - not great writing, but it's a start, and it's getting me to put in time and focus
	* I need to start writing earlier on the day … the contract work is interrupting my flow, and it's harder than I thought it would be.
* Spent all day on contract work … behind where I need to be, figuring out how to call Swift code from Objective-C 
	* Trying to fix buggy logic



## September 19 2018 21:57:50

* Wrote: 869 words 
* Inspired after watching "Dawn Wall" with Tommy Caldwell who scales the Yosemite "impossible" face called Dawn Wall.
	* 6 years working on a goal
		* Spring + Fall spent figuring out the traversals to make one unified climb
* Refactored the outline, it didn't feel right, but now I think I'm on the right track with the topics
* Updated sections, reordered to make more logical
	* Trying to make it as easy as possible to get something working
	* Then we'll explain more complexities … don't talk about what we don't need to talk about yet.

### New Section 1 Chapters

1. Auto Layout 101
2. Test Drive Auto Layout (Get in and do something)
3. Auto Layout Fundamentals
4. Layout  (You need more practice with layout before you constrain)
5. Thinking with Auto Layout (Paper prototyping? prep for design?)

## September 19 2018 17:24:33

* Started writing some ideas … busy day working on contract work and UI testing … still feels like docs aren't fleshed out … I have yet to find the updated Apple docs



## September 18 2018 21:58:07

* Wrote 804 words for Chapter 1
	* Starting point, but I'm starting to think that my daily word count is going to be closer to 2,000 words.
	* I didn't really get into the topic, and my outline doesn't quite flow
	* I'm going to cleanup Chapter 1 outline once more, and then hit the ground running
* Part of the process for writing … and doing this challenge is to push myself to think, eat, and breathe Auto Layout, so that I can write easier
* The more I consume the material, and refine my thoughts, the easier it will be to write this book
* Reading Essentialism has been amazing, habit's are what are going to make this book write itself, I just need to make sure I write daily … 
* I'm going to hang up a calendar that I can cross off each day I hit my word count … it's ok if I only write 50 words, as long as I continue the habit, it will continue to build, and my subconscious will be writing the book in my sleep
* I don't want this book to start off dry, I want to showcase real examples of Auto Layout in action, and then I want to break it down with a real world example
* I'm not here to talk about how constraints work, but how you can leverage constraints to make the UI you want


## September 18 2018 12:50 - 1:30

* Mind map for Chapter 1 (15 minutes)
* Talk through topic (7 minutes)
* Update outline

## September 18 2018 10:00 - 12:00

* Setup the [Auto Layout Book landing page](http://bit.ly/AutoLayoutBook).
* Announced the landing page to my email list, Facebook, and Twitter
* Setup a GoViral page to encourage social shares of the book before launch
